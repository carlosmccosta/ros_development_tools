CLion -> File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> C++ -> Gear -> Import Scheme -> XML

Deviations / improvements in relation to ROS CppStyleGuide:
- Code indentation using tabs instead of 2 spaces
    * This way, you can easily change the visible indentation of the code -> some people like 2 spaces, others like 4, ...)
- Function parameters have an underscore prefix (_function_parameter)
    * This way it is clear the scope of a variable:
        local_stack_variable
        _function_parameter
        class_member_
    * Support for this will be added in CLion 2019.1

- Curly braces on same line as the statement
    * Allows more compact code -> less scrolling
- Larger line length wrap (250 instead of 120)
    * Programmers usually code on 27+ inches monitors, so larger lines means more compact code -> less scrolling
