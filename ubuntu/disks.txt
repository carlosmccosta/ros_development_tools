# Scan partition for damaged blocks:
sudo badblocks -svn /dev/sdXX > /tmp/bad-blocks.txt


# Tell OS to not use the bad blocks
sudo e2fsck -l /tmp/bad-blocks.txt  /dev/sdXX


# Check ext4 partition (make sure it is not mounted first):
unmount /dev/sdXX
e2fsck -vf /dev/sdXX


# For checking root partitions either:

1 - Run:
shutdown -Fr now

2 - Create the file:
touch /forcefsck
